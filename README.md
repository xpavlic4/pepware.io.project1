It's finally Monday!  Your very first Weekly Project!  So here it is:

You're working with an accountant named Arthur.

Arthur has a client, Matilda.  Matilda is 68 years old and sells cupcakes.  Matilda is not a big fan of spreadsheets, accounting software, or computers in general really.

Every so often Matilda sends Arthur three files:

Basic.txt, Delux.txt, and Total.txt
(Download examples here)

Naturally, as any savvy business owner, Matilda wants to understand her business.  So she sends Arthur those files and wants to know: "How much money did I make last year? How much money do I make in a typical month?  Can you help, please? I do need your help,  I'm very busy baking cupcakes, and my arthritis flares up when I spend a whole day on the calculator."

To be totally honest, Arthur is not Matilda's biggest fan right now.  Arthur is glad he finally got her to type up this info and email it instead of faxing it, but she flat out won't do anything more complicated than this.

It could be worse, Matilda is a woman of routine:
These documents never have dates, each line was entered on a different day.  The bottom-most row is always 'Today', the row above that is 'Yesterday', and so on.
The files are always lined up perfectly, you never have to worry about them being 'out of sync' or anything like that.
Basic.txt is the number of basic cupcakes she sold on that day, and they cost $5.  
Deluxe.txt is the number of Deluxe cupcakes (they have sprinkles!) sold on that day, and they cost $6.  
Total.txt is the total money she made (let's not even think about taxes yet, ugh).
Matilda every so often wants to know:
Yearly Revenue Totals
Monthly Revenue Totals
Weekly Revenue Totals
I'll bet that this week you can code something up that will take these text files in and spit those answers out, whenever she asks.

If you want to get fancy, here's how you might take it even further:
Break these stats down by item.
Generate a graph of the data, Matilda loves charts
Get creative with the input.  Maybe you can think of something she'll actually use.
Now, how are you going to attack this project? Everyone has a graveyard of unfinished projects, how are you going to make this one different? 

When you're working at a company, you've got this built in mechanism to force you to work on whatever you should be working on. For your own stuff, there's none of that. Why work on your project when you could be relaxing? Or scrolling through HackerNews, or whatever your preferred method of procrastination is. 

What's the best way to do that? 
Planning. 

Not that procrastination planning where you think about stuff and dream about how awesome it'll be. Real planning, where we make commitments and stuff. 

Let's dive in.

The first step is to decide what. Remember how I said we weren't going to dream about this finished product? I lied. Take a second and think about your perfect vision of this project. 

Now cut it in half. Take about half of the things in that vision, and just decide now not to do them. 

The reality is that in software, things always take longer than we anticipate. We almost always have to skip features at the end that we planned for, so why not do it in advance? We can always add them back in if we have time. 

This also includes spending time on stuff you don't know. Research is an important part of development, and it's OK to spend time on it. 

The second step is to decide when. Think about the week ahead. If you use a calendar or a planner, get that in front of you. 

When is weekly project time? I sometimes catch myself thinking that something will happen "sometime this week". I've looked around, and I haven't found a calendar that has a box with that label. 

Take a minute and schedule some specific times to work on this project. It can just be a few minutes here and there, you don't have to be staying up late every night to get this done if you don't want to. A half hour 3 times a week is way more than none at all. 

If you aren't able to schedule as much time as you want, that's OK! Block out as much time as you can, and then go back to step one and cut out some more project. 

The third step is to commit.  Take your answers to the first two parts and put them in here. 

This is a crucial part of the process. It's really easy to let ourselves slip, but when you commit yourself to someone else, it kicks things up a notch. I read all of these submissions, and I have an idea of how these projects tend to go. If you don't take the time now and plan what, when, and commit, you won't submit anything this week. But if you do, it increases your chances dramatically. 

If you need some help at any point during the week, submit a help request here!  I'll try and connect you with a mentor or send you some resources.
